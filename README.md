# Road Accident Dashboard, (Interactive Dashboard creation using Excel)
## Project Objective
To visualize and analyse road accident data for informed decision-making and to identify trends, risks, and areas of concern in road safety in the UK by using Excel.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Sammuun/Road-Accident-Dashboard-UK/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Data%20(version%201).xlsb.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
-	What is the most common cause of road casualties?
-	Which type of vehicle is involved in the most accidents?
-	Are accidents more common in urban or rural areas?
-	How does light condition affect accident frequency?
-	What trends can be observed when comparing 2021 and 2022 monthly casualty data?
-	Which road type contributes to the most casualties?
-	Are serious or fatal accidents more likely on specific road types or in certain lighting conditions?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/Sammuun/Road-Accident-Dashboard-UK/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-05-03%20130311.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insight
-	Car accidents dominate the statistics, making up nearly 80% of all casualties.
-	Most accidents are slight in nature (84.1%), with only 1.7% resulting in fatalities.
-	Urban areas report more casualties than rural, likely due to higher traffic density.
-	Accidents are more frequent in daylight, but serious/fatal accidents in darkness may need closer inspection.
-	Single carriageways are responsible for the majority of casualties, suggesting a need for infrastructure improvement or policy changes in those areas.
-	Casualty numbers remained fairly stable between 2021 and 2022, with slight monthly variations.

## Final Conclusion:
This dashboard provides a comprehensive look at road accident patterns and their contributing factors. The data can help stakeholders such as traffic safety agencies, urban planners, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to reduce road accidents and enhance public safety. Prioritizing improvements on single carriageways, enforcing speed limits in daylight, and increasing public awareness in urban zones can be effective next steps.
